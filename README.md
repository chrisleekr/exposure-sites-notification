## Why

I built this bot to get notified newest exposure sites that are listed by

- Victoria: [https://www.coronavirus.vic.gov.au/exposure-sites](https://www.coronavirus.vic.gov.au/exposure-sites)
- Queensland: [https://www.qld.gov.au/health/conditions/health-alerts/coronavirus-covid-19/current-status/contact-tracing](https://www.qld.gov.au/health/conditions/health-alerts/coronavirus-covid-19/current-status/contact-tracing)

I visit the public exposure sites frequently to check whether there was any exposure site that I may be exposed. To reduce the time to access the website to check the sites, I simply built this TelegramBot that notifies me whenever the newest sites are listed.
