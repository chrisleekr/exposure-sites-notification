## Why

I built this bot to get notified newest exposure sites that are listed by [Department of Health and Human Services Victoria](https://www.coronavirus.vic.gov.au/exposure-sites).

I visit the public exposure sites frequently to check whether there was any exposure site that I may be exposed. To reduce the time to access the website to check the sites, I simply built this TelegramBot that notifies me whenever the newest sites are listed.
